# Prompt for GPT-4o

**Goal**: Perform a detailed analysis of the commit and file differences between the `integration/v0.0.6` branch and [PR #90](https://github.com/enveng-group/dev_greenova/pull/90). Review all available log files including changed files, conflicts, commit history, diff stats, and repository status to provide a comprehensive analysis. Focus on evaluating changes to the `Makefile` and determine whether the modifications improve its functionality. Provide actionable recommendations on which changes to retain, dismiss, or enhance. Ensure that only files directly related to the PR, particularly the `Makefile`, are modified, and verify that no unrelated files from `integration/v0.0.6` are unintentionally updated.

**Objectives**:

- Compare the `Makefile` changes in PR #90 against the `integration/v0.0.6` branch to assess improvements in functionality and maintainability.
- Identify any unintended modifications to files unrelated to the `Makefile` or the scope of PR #90.
- Evaluate the insights generated by the `scripts/pre-merge.fish` script and cross-reference them with the `analysis_logs/pre_merge_analysis.log` file.
- Provide actionable recommendations on which `Makefile` changes to retain, dismiss, or enhance based on their impact and alignment with project goals.
- Ensure compliance with project standards and verify that no unrelated files from `integration/v0.0.6` are unintentionally updated.
- Validate that all pre-commit checks pass without errors and address any flagged issues.
- Document findings and recommendations clearly for review and implementation.
- Analyze all available log files to gather comprehensive insights about the changes and their impact.
- Review commit history patterns and diff statistics to understand the scope of changes.
- Monitor repository status for any unexpected modifications.
- Reference the [GNU Make manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.txt) to ensure adherence to best practices when reviewing the `Makefile` changes.

**Additional Issues Identified**:

- Conflict markers need removal: The `logs/conflict_analysis.log` shows leftover conflict markers in the Makefile on lines 53, 55, and 66, which need to be resolved:

  ```log
  Makefile:53: leftover conflict marker
  Makefile:55: leftover conflict marker
  Makefile:66: leftover conflict marker
  ```

- Trailing whitespace: There's trailing whitespace in the PHONY target list on line 1:

  ```log
  Makefile:1: trailing whitespace.
  +.PHONY: app install venv dotenv-pull dotenv-push check run run-django run-tailwind dev compile-proto check-tailwind tailwind tailwind-install migrations migrate static user db import update sync update-recurring-dates normalize-frequencies clean-csv prod lint-templates format-templates check-templates format-lint django-build
  ```

- Ensure no other files are being modified from PR #90. The only file that should be changed, if needed, is the Makefile. All other files must remain unmodified unless directly related to the Makefile changes. Carefully check whether the Makefile changes are good or bad before making any recommendations or updates.

**Context**:

```log

```

**Tasks**:

1. Review all available log files for comprehensive analysis:
   - Analyze changed_files.log to identify all modified files
   - Review conflict_analysis.log for potential merge conflicts
   - Study commit_history.log to understand change patterns
   - Examine diff_stats.log for scope of modifications
   - Check repo_status.log for repository health
   - Cross-reference pre_merge_analysis.log for detailed findings
2. Compare the `Makefile` changes in PR #90 against the `integration/v0.0.6` branch to evaluate improvements in functionality and maintainability.
3. Identify any unintended modifications to files unrelated to the `Makefile` or the scope of PR #90.
4. Cross-reference the insights from the `scripts/pre-merge.fish` script with the `analysis_logs/pre_merge_analysis.log` file to validate findings.
5. Provide actionable recommendations on which `Makefile` changes to retain, dismiss, or enhance based on their impact and alignment with project goals.
6. Verify compliance with project standards and ensure no unrelated files from `integration/v0.0.6` are unintentionally updated.
7. Run all pre-commit checks and address any flagged issues to ensure compliance with coding standards.
8. Document findings and recommendations clearly for review and implementation.
9. Consult the [GNU Make manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.txt) for best practices and guidelines when reviewing the `Makefile` changes.

**Expectations**: GitHub Copilot can delete and consolidate files where
multiple implementations are found and can be merged into a single file
globally. Always use `use context7` to lookup documentation from the context7
MCP server, which provides access to all project-specific configuration files
and standards. Additional resources such as the github, filesystem, JSON,
context7, sqlite, git, fetch, sequential-thinking, and docker MCP servers have
been activated and are available for use by GitHub Copilot.

**Instructions**:

1. Identify and remove unnecessary or outdated files, code, or documentation
   that no longer serves the project's objectives. Clearly define the task's
   scope to focus only on relevant elements flagged in pre-commit checks.
2. Organize project resources, including tools, code, and documentation, into a
   logical structure. Ensure naming conventions and folder hierarchies are
   consistent, making it easier to locate and work with files.
3. Create stub files (.pyi files) for internal modules that don't have proper
   type information.
4. Add a py.typed marker file to indicate these modules have type information
5. Refactor the code to address issues such as readability, maintainability,
   and technical debt. Implement clean coding practices and resolve any flagged
   issues in the pre-commit output, such as formatting or style violations.
6. Use automated tools like bandit, autopep8, mypy, eslint, djlint,
   markdownlint, ShellCheck, and pylint to enforce coding standards. Validate
   compliance with the project's guidelines and ensure all pre-commit checks
   pass without errors. Iterate running `pre-commit` to check for any remaining
   issues after each change. Do not use the command
   `pre-commit run --all-files`.
7. Ensure that the code is well-documented, with clear explanations of
   functions, classes, and modules. Use docstrings and comments to clarify
   complex logic or important decisions made during development.
8. Test the code thoroughly to ensure it works as intended and meets the
   project's requirements. Write unit tests and integration tests as needed,
   and ensure that all tests pass before finalizing the changes.
9. Iterate until resolved.
